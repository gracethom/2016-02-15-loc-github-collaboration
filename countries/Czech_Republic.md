## interesting trivia


At the close of World War I, the Czechs and Slovaks of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire merged to form 
Czechoslovakia. During the interwar years, having rejected a federal system, the new country's predominantly Czech 
leaders were frequently preoccupied with meeting the increasingly strident demands of other ethnic minorities within 
the republic, most notably the Slovaks, the Sudeten Germans, and the Ruthenians (Ukrainians). On the eve of World War 
II, Nazi Germany occupied the territory that today comprises Czechia, and Slovakia became an independent state allied 
with Germany. After the war, a reunited but truncated Czechoslovakia (less Ruthenia) fell within the Soviet sphere of 
influence. In 1968, an invasion by Warsaw Pact troops ended the efforts of the country's leaders to liberalize 
communist rule and create "socialism with a human face," ushering in a period of repression known as "normalization." 
The peaceful "Velvet Revolution" swept the Communist Party from power at the end of 1989 and inaugurated a return to 
democratic rule and a market economy. On 1 January 1993, the country underwent a nonviolent "velvet divorce" into its 
two national components, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The Czech Republic joined NATO in 1999 and the European 
Union in 2004. The country changed its short-form name to Czechia in 2016.
